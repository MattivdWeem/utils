# utils
Repository with usefull utilitys (Stored in json/php or just simple functions that are overall usefull)

Lists of data that are often used but not that often, smart written php class that is loadable via composer to use this kind of data.

Also some simple overal usefull functions which i need on a lot of my projects but not enough for their own repository.

The repo is build up in a simple way

     - php array/object
     - other data formats

     utils.php
     - per direct function a folder
     

Do you need the data for usage? Just go in there and take it! I don't care it's all opensource :')
